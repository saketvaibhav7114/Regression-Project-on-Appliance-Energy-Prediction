The Appliance Energy Prediction project focuses on predicting the total energy usage (in kWh) of a house based on time series data obtained from the UCI repository. The dataset includes temperatures (in Celsius) and humidity percentages from different rooms of the house, along with additional weather data from the Chivers weather station, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The main objective is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the energy consumption of household appliances using these available variables.

The first step of the project is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's features and their relationships. The analysis will provide insights into data distributions, correlations, and potential patterns related to energy consumption. The project aims to handle any missing values by imputing them closer to real-world values, ensuring data integrity for model building.

Next, the project addresses the presence of outliers, as they can distort model estimation. Outliers will be carefully handled or removed to improve the model's performance and prediction accuracy.

Feature engineering is an essential part of the project. The plan is to add extra features that could provide additional information and improve the model's prediction capabilities. These engineered features will be chosen based on their potential impact on the target variable and insights from previous work on similar Kaggle problems.

As the dataset might contain correlated features, the project aims to remove redundant variables and retain the most informative ones. In cases where features are highly correlated, the plan is to replace them with alternatives that have less impact on the target variable but still provide valuable information.

To ensure accurate model training, the data will be properly scaled. Scaling is essential for both parametric and non-parametric models to maintain consistent data distributions.

The project will then proceed with building and evaluating three different models: Support Vector Machines (SVM), one boosting algorithm, and one bagging algorithm. Hyperparameter tuning will be performed to find the best parameters for each model, enhancing their predictive capabilities.

Finally, once the best model and hyperparameters are determined, the plan is to save the model weights to avoid retraining in the future, ensuring efficiency and quick predictions.

The Appliance Energy Prediction project aims to deliver a robust predictive model that can accurately estimate household appliance energy consumption. By leveraging advanced modelling techniques and thorough data analysis, the project seeks to provide valuable insights into energy usage patterns, contributing to energy conservation and informed decision-making for homeowners and utility companies alike.
